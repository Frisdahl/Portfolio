## Reference vibe (must match)
Target: dark editorial portfolio like Alexandre Huet. https://anthracitestudio.be/

Layout rules:
- Fullscreen hero (min-h-screen), no card layout
- Top-left: brand/name
- Top-right: minimal nav (small, spaced)
- Center-left: HUGE headline in uppercase, tight leading, mixed weights
- Bottom-left: small social links row (IG FB LK TEL MAIL AWWWARDS)
- Bottom-right: short paragraph (max 2–3 lines)
- One thin horizontal divider line across near bottom
- Oversized faint “watermark” word(s) behind content near bottom (very low opacity)

Typography:
- Uppercase headline
- Tight tracking on large text
- Small nav + small meta text
- Strong hierarchy (headline dominates 70% of hero)

Visual style:
- Dark monochrome background with subtle wave/noise texture
- No bright primary button
- Accents only as small underline/highlight

Avoid:
- Centered “headline + button” template
- Big CTA button
- White background / boxed sections
